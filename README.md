# NextJS Starter with Tailwind.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) starter, styled using [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/).  
I primarly use this starter myself when creating new NextJS projects, but feel free to use and alter it to your own use.

### üöÄ Further tools that are set up out-of-the-box:

- [PurgeCSS](https://github.com/FullHuman/purgecss) (to remove unused CSS)
- [CSSNano](https://cssnano.co/) (to minify production build)
- [TailwindUI](https://tailwindui.com/) (extension to the Tailwind framework)

### üéóÔ∏è Linter/formatter:

- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
